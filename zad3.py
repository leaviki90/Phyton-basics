#3.	Area of a rectangle
# Third task
a = int(input())  # Reads input from the console as a string, then converts it to an integer using int()
b = int(input())  # Does the same for the second input
# int() is a function that takes input() as an argument and converts it to an integer

# c = a * b  # This line multiplies a and b, storing the result in c, but is commented out
# print(c)  # This line prints the result stored in c, but is commented out

# Alternatively, you can directly print the result of a multiplication
print(a * b)  # This line calculates and prints the result of a * b without storing it in a variable

# print() can take an expression, calculate it, and display the result as text without storing the result in a variable
