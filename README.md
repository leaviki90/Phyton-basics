Python Basics
=============

I'm starting my journey to learn Python basics, and this repository will serve as a collection of everything I learn while following the Python course from [SoftUni](https://www.softuni.rs/besplatan-kurs-python-programiranja-septembar-2024/).

What to Expect:
---------------

*   **Working with Console Input and Output**: Learning how to interact with users through the console.
    
*   **Loops (for, while)**: Mastering loops to efficiently repeat tasks in code.
    
*   **Logical Statements (if-else)**: Understanding how to make decisions in code using conditional statements.
    
*   **Simple Calculations**: Performing basic mathematical operations in Python.
    
*   **Nested Loops**: Delving deeper into loops by learning how to use loops within loops.
    

I'll be updating this repository as I progress, adding code examples, notes, and exercises. Feel free to explore and learn along with me!
